# Portfolio Website (Old Version)

‚ö†Ô∏è This version of my portfolio is no longer maintained.

I've redesigned and rebuilt my portfolio using **React**, and it's now hosted on a new platform for a better experience.

üëâ **Visit the new version here:** [View New Portfolio](https://kuldeep-chavda-portfolio.netlify.app/)

This repository previously hosted a personal portfolio built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, featuring:

- Responsive layout
- Clean UI
- Pages: Home, About, Skills, Projects, Contact

The GitHub Pages version now shows a message directing visitors to the new portfolio.
